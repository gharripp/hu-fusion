# Nuclear Fusion: Powering Our Future

Nuclear fusion is the same process that powers the Sun and stars, where atomic nuclei combine to form heavier elements, releasing massive amounts of energy in the process. At Hampton University's STAR-lite facility, we're working to harness this power for clean, sustainable energy generation.

## How Fusion Works

When light atomic nuclei fuse together, they release enormous amounts of energy. The most promising reaction for fusion power involves deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen):
- Deuterium can be extracted from seawater
- The reaction produces no greenhouse gases
- The process is inherently safe

## Our Approach: The Stellarator

At STAR-lite (Stellarator for Training and Research), we focus on magnetic confinement fusion using a stellarator design. Stellarators:
- Use specially-shaped magnetic fields to contain hot plasma
- Offer steady-state operation
- Represent one of the most promising paths to fusion energy

## Research Focus Areas

### Plasma Physics
